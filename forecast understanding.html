            <h3>Winds</h3>
            <h5>It is important to understand the wind directions; what they mean and how they will affect our surf. When the wind blows offshore, which is not very common when the waves are good in Florida, the wind is blowing from land to the ocean. When surfing offshore conditions with winds greater than 9 Kts it may be a bit more difficult to paddle into a wave. Light offshores make for very fun and glassy conditions, but Florida normally doesnt have offshores with fun waves for that long. When the wind is blowing onshore, the wind is coming from the sea and blowing towards the land. 
                This is where most of our wind swells come from as these mainly come from cold-fronts or north-easters the sit off our coastline. These make the waves have more of a "choppy" face, but wind swells can be very fun. If the onshores are too high however, it may be blown out and way too choppy for rideable conditions. 
                When the wind blows crosshore/sideshore the winds either combine with an on or offshore wind direction or it can strictly blow north or south. If these winds blow too strong it can make it difficult to paddle into waves. Say you wanna take off on a left and the winds are blowing too hard south it will be difficult to paddle into or the wave is too weak. Same goes for going right when the winds blow too hard north. When the crosshore/sideshore takes its dominance over a offshore or onshore wind direction there will be a HEAVY current. 
                If the winds were to be NNE (north northeast) expect a current taking you south. If its blowing hard SSE (south southeast), expect a HEAVY current taking you north.</h5>

                <h3> Swell Periods</h3>
                <h5>Swell periods are another fundamental thing to understand. These are measured in seconds and are the times in between for waves that pulse, and they can work in tandem with the winds. 
                    If we have anything over a 10 second period, then there is a ground swell, or a hurricane swell in the ocean.
                    If the swell periods are short (somewhere between 5 to 6 seconds ideally) but the winds are high and are onshore, we have a wind swell, refer to the wind paragraph about onshores and wind swells.

                <h3>Wave Height</h3>
                <h5>There is some discourse on this topic, due to the "Hawaiian wave scale" and eyeballing the wave at the beach and assuming its knee high. 
                    When looking at wave height you have to take into account the swell period time. This is due to the swell system being further out to sea (ground) and how long it takes to travel to the shore and the amount of energy it takes to get there generates more power in the wave and a bigger wave face than expected. 
                    As a example when you read a buoy that says 3ft @ 13sec, this can be considered a ground swell and the wave may not exactly be 3ft it might be a chest to head high wave for the average surfer.

                <h3>Tides</h3>
                <h5>Tides may not play a big part on determining  swells, but they do play an important part in how the wave breaks. 
                    When a certain spot hits high tide and it has a weak outer sandbar, the spot may be useless and the wave is just crashing on the shore even though there is a swell. Wait about 6 hours or so and paddle out again. 
                    Same goes for weak sandbars that only work well at high tide. The wave dredges and slams on the shore. In Florida "sandbar restoration" is a joke with all its fake sand hence the weak sandbars. </h5>
